/**
 * Created by Erich on 7/3/2016.
 *
 * This class is used to compare the distance between two graphs learned from fmri data
 * the distance is calculated as the mean of the distance of the edges between the graphs
 * the distance between two edges is calculated as the distance between their endpoints
 * the distance between edges calculated this way is a true distance
 * the distance between two graphs is not a true distance because it is not symmetric
